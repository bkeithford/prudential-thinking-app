# Prudential Thinking App

*A digital "angel on your shoulder" for developing wisdom and good judgment*

## Vision

This app helps users internalize the classical 8 elements of prudential thinking through interactive flashcards and randomized wisdom prompts. The goal is to build habits of reflective thinking that users can apply "in the moment" during real-life decisions.

> "My every waking hour elapses within the context of my having to deliberate, evaluate/judge, choose/decide, act or refrain... I'm seeking a metaphorical 'li'l angel on my shoulder' whispering in my ear to 'be wise...do what's right, be courageous, be temperate'" - Project Creator

## The 8 Elements of Prudence

### 1. **Docility** - Openness to Learning
- Am I teachable regarding this?
- Who knows more about this than I do?
- Where can I get feedback, even if it challenges my viewpoint?

### 2. **Understanding** - Clear Perception  
- Am I being as perceptive as I should be?
- Do I see the details and the context?
- What's the plain, uncolored truth?

### 3. **Memory** - Learning from Experience
- What do I recall as I look backward?
- What similar situation have I faced?
- What lesson from my past might apply?

### 4. **Reason** - Logical Thinking
- How can I be more rational?
- What evidence supports my decision, and what contradicts it?
- Are any emotions influencing my judgment, and how can I set them aside?

### 5. **Circumspection** - Situational Awareness
- What do I see as I "look around" this situation?
- Are there multiple angles I can look from?
- What assumptions am I making, that I'm not aware I'm making, that give me what I see?

### 6. **Foresight** - Future Thinking
- What do I see when I look ahead of this moment?
- What can I imagine to happen next?
- What long-term goals and values might be impacted?

### 7. **Shrewdness** - Adaptive Intelligence
- How can I be more nimble?
- How can I exploit the unexpected?
- What's a "quick fix" in a pinch?

### 8. **Caution** - Prudent Action
- How can I be careful?
- Am I in a rush that I might regret?
- What are possible negative consequences of my action?
